cannot tell you more 
ran to the toilet 
uses his belt on you 
don't want to hear it 
man's hair is black 
your hearing aid up 
smiled and sat down 
horse has thrown a shoe 
knew I heard your voice 
stayed against the wall 
tube train took his legs 
walked up to the door 
wrote on the envelope 
called over his shoulder 
demand nothing of me 
gave Adam two pounds 
were looking up again 
wouldn't want to miss this 
put the fork on the table 
lost control and laughed 
am touched deeply in places 
felt his anger build up 
needed putting in his place 
give him more than a slap 
will be listening for sure 
sat back down and shivered 
couldn't help feel for Alex 
riding out to meet them 
like a walk did the trick 
sat down to eat his lunch 
campaign will pay for itself 
barely escaped with our lives 
felt proud when he went home 
got up and washed his plate 
stood up and wiped his jeans 
shouted and the calling ceased 
broken his wrists very badly 
smiled and bit his bottom lip 
had refused to leave her home 
dead must not kill the living 
van is your lead, follow that 
smiled at his little brother 
hid the boxes and matches well 
called out but she did not move 
do not spare the birds a killing 
they want to cut things up 
in the wrong hands, is that 
will be men to kill either way 
nodded and walked into the room 
prison guard walked along the row 
slammed the knife down on the lamb 
smiled when she let out a big yawn 
give me a lead and I'll follow it 
bored looking soldier just pointed 
is looking for somewhere to live 
stepped back and shook his head 
stopped off at his first delivery 
getting up early in the morning 
sat down and began to eat breakfast 
saw the throwing knife in his hand 
is a narrow ship, much like our own 
get out and I'll buy you a drink 
been travelling almost three days 
forgot to shave again this morning 
a carriage sent for us immediately 
probably doesn't want people to know 
lunch he was told he had visitors 
staggered into the chair at his desk 
us leave these poor people in peace 
of the city people dress like that 
your smart foul mouth and sit down 
just wished he could talk to his dad 
closed the door and took a breath 
is after glory and heads for his hall 
within the walls to escape the enemy 
me what really happened to the truck 
gave Bernard a hard slap on the head 
else had dared step within the ring 
him now, don't wait for him to escape 
die of cold before you die in battle 
sighed and walked back to the wood shop 
took a breath and wanted to be sick 
nodded and stood against the counter 
spoke before Barbara had a chance to 
was smiling in the dark, teeth flashing 
felt sick to the pit of his stomach 
turned and saw him standing in her path 
could be paid to do all sorts of things 
me closely and watch for their leader 
door was opened and Alexander walked out 
closed the office door on the way out 
men will not follow him and they are few 
would soon be found if she tried to hide 
stood against the wall to steady himself 
lay his sword aside and extended his hands 
have the gates closed and go home early 
sat down and tucked into his breakfast 
were choked screams and shouts of dismay 
liked the fact they were calling him Jim 
let him go and Charlie fell to the ground 
went to the door and walked out of the room 
know that I will do whatever you ask of me 
think our friend's demands are well justified 
God, if you are watching, give me strength 
heaved his shoulders and swung the axe again 
kicked him in the stomach and Paul groaned 
sighed and tried to move out of the way 
was leaning against his truck smoking a joint 
washed his hands and flicked water at Bob 
break your neck if you don't fix that water 
sat as still as he could nursing his lip 
took a cigarette and Andy gave him a light 
along home now and bring us some men to kill 
bored looking soldier continued looking bored 
still teaches and still claims to hate it 
was thinking of getting the band together again 
me through and you'll hear nothing more of it 
smile came to his lips as he thought of an idea 
the man is coming who will give it back to me 
placed the bars of chocolate on the counter 
Peter heard him or not Gabriel didn't care 
the bowls from the empty tables are cleared up 
dark hair was just visible under his white hat 
gave Geoffrey a hard slap across his right ear 
sat down and Lucy laid her hand on his cheek 
turned round just as Frankie walked toward them 
the table her hand was gripping the chair 
is not the most fragrant of places but we make do 
brothers stood up and came down from the platform 
held his mother tight and she cried into his chest 
helmet was lost but he could still do some damage 
wound up talking to Barry about her time in India 
know better than to talk to your mother like that 
shall have a victory and I want it to be remembered 
put her mug of tea down on the table with a bang 
let Donald go and he fell to the floor with a thud 
opened his letter and found a photograph inside 
walked into the office and removed his flat cap 
drove his truck home and walked down to the village 
rubbed the back of his neck and hung his head 
just kept telling herself he had to learn a lesson 
am trying, old man, but I would rather kill the ship 
were definitely holding hands underneath the table 
smiled again at his baby daughter, she was perfect 
sniffed and wiped his grubby hand across his nose 
just hoped he wasn't taking his temper out on Chris 
Maria sat down with a cup of tea and a sandwich 
folded his arms across his chest and put out his lip 
groaned and lay his hands across his stomach 
didn't seem to mind that she was screaming in his ear 
smiled again and felt like a man and not just the kid 
mostly just pick a dry white and drink it to get drunk 
shall arrive properly or you will never live this down 
they sat drinking their tea, Mick dug them a trench 
drank too much at times and washed too little at times 
first knife caught in her skirt and she shook it free 
flung out my hands and they said I had broken my wrists 
gathered villagers took a step back, almost as one man 
shouldn't have been racing my truck in the first place 
had been two weeks since Philip had been sent to prison 
had another shock when they told him he was moving cells 
us give battle to these foreign snakes once and for all 
told Jason he would just sit outside to have his lunch 
truck was an older version of the ones the others drove 
knocked on the door so hard that he almost broke it down 
can't see any amount of talk getting you out of this mess 
sat his son up on the table and laid his belt beside him 
I have time at the end I'll fill you in on what happened 
gate was double, one huge mass of wood following another 
last week there was a white van parked across the street 
put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the truck 
walked in to wake Samuel at four thirty in the morning 
last thing Alex felt like doing after work was more work 
got the ability to work but he just gets bored too easy 
felt good when he got ready to go out on Saturday night 
shout caught him off guard and he fell back a little way 
speaker turned to her with a smile and a bow of his head 
was approached, just as he had predicted, in the park 
stood against the wall with his hands behind his back 
was built with muscle and liked to throw his weight around 
came out of the staff room toilet looking a little pale 
knew they never hit him and that was half the problem 
stared at the black wall and now this offered no comfort 
don't you tell me what happened on Saturday, step by step 
knocked on the door and waited till he was told to enter 
say he can breathe fire and kill a man with a single word 
was only in the cell for an hour but it felt like a week 
what Frank had told her Ellen thanked the young soldier 
is looking for someone to take the spare room in his flat 
the moment we leave this spot be very careful what you say 
sat down at an empty table and began to eat his breakfast 
this were a movie instead of a book this would be a good bit 
called earlier and I already arranged to go swimming tomorrow 
threatened to leave before and this time she just had enough 
should talk about the things people talk about on first dates 
sat at the entrance to the warehouse and made up a cigarette 
rose from his seat and stopped mid way when Joe glared at him 
washed his hands and sat on the seat in front of the stove 
police officer got out of the van and picked up the two cans 
came back to his senses when he heard his dad stand up to him 
was already up and dressed and invited us in for a cup of tea 
the morning at breakfast Mike smiled at the letter he received 
by one she placed her teeth about their necks and killed them 
know Richard drinks a little too much and has a bit of a temper 
the morning Mickey stood straight with his hand behind his back
